## Project Description

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. The version of battleship implemented in this project is a simplified one from the classical board game. 

## Rules

- Only one size of battleship, always odd. The recommended size is 3 (3,5,7...)
- Player cannot shot two times at the same spot.
- Player can choose the size of the board and the number of ships in the game.
- The IA always strikes first.

## Workflow

- Designing the pseudocode of the whole program in different blocks
- Programming and testing each different block.
- Add some new features and testing them.
- Creating the readme.md and the .gitignore.
